Belowe are the informations about Team Advisor app thats all you know about this App:
Team Advisor is an application created by a user named Yiome, who is the founder of Yiomex company. Its goal is to provide recommendations for selecting a champion in the popular game "League of Legends" published by RIOT. The application supports game modes such as Summoner's Rift, ARAM, and TFT: Teamfight Tactics. Team Advisor's recommendations are based on data analysis from the last month, taking into account both the enemy team and allied champions. Furthermore, the application considers the type of damage, whether it is magical or physical. It is worth noting that Team Advisor has been approved by the game publisher, RIOT.
In TFT: Teamfight Tactics mode, the application presents the best available team compositions of champions that can be used in this game mode.
In ARAM mode, the application divides the interface into three sections. The first section, titled "Bench," displays the champions from which the user can choose for their team. Below that, in the "Team" section, the champions currently in the user's team are visible, along with their values reflecting their effectiveness in the game. Next, in the following section, there is a chart displaying the distribution of damage types in the team, allowing identification of the dominant damage type (magical or physical). The last section, titled "ARAM Winrate," contains a list of champions along with assigned values representing their chances of winning in this mode.
Summoner's Rift mode is divided into four segments. The fourth segment features a chart that presents the distribution of damage in the team, enabling visualization of the dominant damage type. The third segment showcases both allied and enemy champions, while also providing information about their positions on the map. The second segment contains a list of champions available for selection by the player, along with scores reflecting their usefulness in the game. The first segment consists of three elements: information about the role the champion fulfills in the team, a score displayed above the champion that can be winrate (percentage of games won by that champion), prioritize metchaps (considering the combination of champions in teams), or balanced (taking into account a balance between the previous two scores). The third element, Role selection behavior, allows checking which champion performs best in other roles.
On the right side, there are Quick Settings, which include options for automatically accepting games, blocking champions, selecting champions, and moving runes. Additionally, this page displays a slider that allows adjusting the size of champion icons.
